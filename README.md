# Triangulator

A modding tool for Cossacks 2 & Heroes of Annihilated Empires.

Unfortunatelly, this version of the code only supports .gp2 (HoAE) files. I may re-add the support for .g2d files if i have time in the feature, but if you want feel free to implement it yourself and create a pull request :)

Read more about its usage [here](https://cossacks2modding.wiki.gg/wiki/Triangulator).

## How to build?

Install [Borland C++ Builder 6.0](https://winworldpc.com/product/borland-c-builder/6x).
